**Hospital Management System (HMS)**
Project Overview
This is a console-based Hospital Management System (HMS) built in Python. It simulates the core functionalities of a hospital's scheduling and record-keeping processes, allowing Admins to manage hospital personnel (Doctors and Staff) and Patients to autonomously book and manage their appointments.

The system uses local JSON files for data persistence, mimicking a basic database setup.

**Features**
//Admin Dashboard
Doctor Management: Add, View, Update, and Delete doctor records, including specialization and shift timings.

Staff Management: Add, View, Update, and Delete non-medical staff records (e.g., Nurses, Receptionists).

Appointment Control: Cancel any appointment using its Appointment ID.

//Patient Portal
